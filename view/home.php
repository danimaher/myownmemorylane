My Own Memory Lane is a tool designed to assist the memory-impaired with
remembering loved ones and significant memories. If you are the
caregiver of someone who lives with a memory-impacting form of dementia such as Alzheimer's, we
offer hosting of a custom website using images and captions that
you provide.</p> 
<p style="text-align: right;">
My Own Memory Lane is great for use with smartphones and tablets for on-the-go access to the captioned images. Another suggested use is to have My Own Memory Lane running in the background on a television or monitor.</p>
